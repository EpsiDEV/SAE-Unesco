        <h2>Creating the castle</h2>
        <small>12th century</small>
        <p>
          The Château de Fontainebleau dates back to the 12th century,
          marking the emergence of this historic site as an emblematic
          royal residence. Originally built as a fortress, the château was
          gradually transformed into a royal residence under the reign
          reign of François I in the 16th century.<span id="dots1">..</span><span id="more1"> The first phases of construction
          were initiated by Louis VII in the middle of the 12th century,
          laying the foundations for what was to become a place of power and
          power and prestige. However, it was really under François
          I that the château underwent a major architectural metamorphosis,
          with the introduction of the Renaissance style and the addition of sumptuous
          elements such as the famous François I wing. The Château de
          Château de Fontainebleau is the fruit of centuries of architectural
          reflecting the history and tastes of the successive sovereigns
          who have contributed to its greatness.</span>

        <h2>François 1st</h2>
        <small>1515 - 1547</small>
        <p>
          The reign of François I, which lasted from 1515 to 1547
          profoundly marked the history of France, both politically
          both politically and culturally. François I is often regarded as the first
          the first Renaissance king in France, and his patronage of the arts
          had a significant influence on the development of art and culture
          culture in the country.<span id="dots2">..</span><span id="more2"> Under his reign, the Château de Fontainebleau
            was transformed into a sumptuous residence, with the introduction of the
            Italian Renaissance style. François I also encouraged cultural
            cultural exchanges with Italy, inviting artists such as Leonardo da Vinci
            Leonardo da Vinci to his court. On the political front, Francis I
            was involved in major conflicts, notably the Italian War
            the Italian War, where he competed with Charles V. Despite military
            military setbacks, his reign consolidated royal power in France and
            cultural foundations that have endured over the centuries.
            Thus, the reign of François I remains a key period in French history
            marked by a balance between political ambitions and artistic
            and artistic achievements.</span>

        <p>
          Henri IV, King of France from 1589 to 1610, left a significant mark
          on the Château de Fontainebleau by ordering the construction of the
          construction of the Cour des Adieux. Built in the early
          17th century, is of major symbolic importance.<span id="dots3">..</span><span id="more3"> Henri IV,
          to consolidate his reign and restore stability to the kingdom after the
          kingdom after the Wars of Religion, chose Fontainebleau as the venue for this
          for this initiative. The Cour des Adieux was intended to mark
          mark the king's solemn departure and symbolize his unchallenged
          authority. The architectural design of this courtyard reflects a unique
          combination of symmetry and grandeur, embodying the idea of royal
          of royal authority, while allowing for memorable farewells. For example,
          Henri IV's order for the construction of the Cour des Adieux at
          Fontainebleau testifies to his concern to consolidate royal power
          and to inscribe his reign in the architectural and symbolic history

          Napoleon Bonaparte's abdication in 1814 marked a major turning point in
          a major turning point in European history. After a series of
          military defeats, notably the disastrous Russian campaign in

            put an end to his imperial reign and paved the way for his exile to

            a period of monarchical restoration in France, marking the end of the

          The abdication of Charles X in 1830 was a significant episode in French
          French history that marked the end of the Restoration. Charles
          X, the last monarch of the eldest branch of the Bourbons, had succeeded
          his brother Louis XVIII in 1824. His reign was marked by conservative

            revolution, Charles X abdicated on 2 August 1830 in favour of his grandson
            his grandson Henri, Duke of Bordeaux. However, this
            quickly considered invalid by the revolutionaries, and the monarchy
